# Algorithm and Data Structure (AlgoDS)

All data structure and algorithm are hand-written. I learned them during the boot-camp by Colt Steele. Kept it here for R3(reference, revision and reading). 

## Data Structure

 - ES6 Class
 - Singly Linked list
 - Doubly Linked list
 - Stack
 - Queue
 - Binary Search Tree
 - Binary Heap (Max)
 - Priority Queue (Min)
 - Hash Table (Separate Chaining)
 - Graph (Undirected + Adjacency list)
 - Weighted Graph

 ## Algorithms

 - Sliding window
 - Multi pointer
 - Frequency pointer
 - Binary Search
 - Single-loop Sort
 - Bubble Sort
 - Insertion Sort
 - Merge Sort
 - Quick Sort
 - Radix Sort
 - Selection Sort
 - Dijkstra Algorithm
 - Dynamic Programming(Memoization & Tabulation)
